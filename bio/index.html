    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a sophomore at Haverford College studying mathematics and economics. My interests are in macroeconomic and financial research, and I am specifically curious about monetary economics and central banking. My work has been <a href="https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/communication/7951981/book-notes-cant-we-just-print-more-money-by-rupal-patel-and-jack-meaning">published</a> in a leading industry magazine, Central Banking, and I am currently co-authoring a <a href="/pages/working-papers/data/GangolfGoyalRoss_CovidReopenings.pdf">conference paper</a> on state-level variations in Covid reopening procedures.</p>
    <p>My recent experience includes working as a research assistant for Prof. Carola Binder, a prominent expert in monetary policy and inflation expectations. In this role, I wrote reports and synthesized research for a forthcoming book on price controls. I also worked on quantitative projects involving NGDP expectations and ideological bias in central bank communications.</p>
    <p>I am highly proficient in Stata, R, Mathematica, and LaTeX, and I have a working knowledge of Python, Java, SQL, and HTML. I speak French with a professional working proficiency.</p>
    <p>At Haverford, I co-head two clubs—the Economics Research Club and the Problem Solving Group (Haverford's math club)—and I play for the varsity cricket team. After college, I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in economics.</p>
