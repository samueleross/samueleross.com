I am an incoming summer research intern at the Federal Reserve Board. I currently study mathematics and economics at Haverford College. 

My academic interests include macroeconomic and financial research&mdash;I am specifically curious about monetary economics and central banking. My work has been [published](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/communication/7951981/book-notes-cant-we-just-print-more-money-by-rupal-patel-and-jack-meaning) in a leading industry magazine&mdash;Central Banking&mdash;and I am currently co-authoring a [conference paper](/assets/pdf/GangolfGoyalRoss_CovidReopenings.pdf) on state-level variations in covid reopening procedures.

I was previously a research assistant for Professor [Carola Binder](https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu), a prominent expert in monetary policy and inflation expectations, contributing to her forthcoming book about price controls and to quantitative projects involving NGDP expectations and bias in central bank communications. I am proficient in Stata, R, Mathematica, and LaTeX, and have experience with Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, and HTML. I speak French with a working proficiency.

At Haverford, I lead two clubs: the Economics Research Club and the Problem Solving Group (Math Club). I also play for the varsity cricket team. After college, I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in economics.
