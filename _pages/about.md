I am a research intern at the Federal Reserve Board studying mathematics and economics at Haverford College. My principal interests are finance, industrial organization, and monetary economics. After college, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in economics and a career as an academic.

My research experience includes coauthoring a [conference paper](/assets/pdf/GangolfGoyalRoss_CovidReopenings.pdf) involving Covid reopening policies; analyzing large datasets using SQL, Stata, and R; and writing tools like web scrapers and machine learning algorithms in Python. I also recently wrote a book review for Central Banking magazine with Professor [Carola Binder](https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu).

At Haverford, I lead the Economics Research Club and the Problem Solving Group (math club) and play for the varsity cricket team. I enjoy fly fishing and crosswords.
