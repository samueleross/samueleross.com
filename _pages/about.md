I am a research assistant for Professor [Kenneth S. Rogoff](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/home) at Harvard University studying mathematics and economics at Haverford College. My principal research interests are macroeconomics and finance. After college, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in economics and a career as an academic.

In the past, I've worked as a summer intern on the DSGE team at the New York Fed, as a year-round intern in Stress Testing Research at the Federal Reserve Board, and as a research assistant for Professor [Carola Binder](https://sites.google.com/site/carolabindereconomics/home) at Haverford. Her book [Shock Values](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo215190546.html), which I helped assemble research for, came out this spring.

At Haverford, I lead the Economics Club and the Problem Solving Group (a math competition club) and play for the varsity cricket team. I enjoy fly fishing and crosswords in my free time.
